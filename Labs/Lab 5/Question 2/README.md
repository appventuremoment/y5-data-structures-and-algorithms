For this question, refer to the resource files given in FileMergeQnResources.zip

You are given two very big files of records (records1.csv and records2.csv),  both already sorted in the the order of id.

Each record is such that it is in the format <id>,<name>,<address>,<occupation>


Your task is to write all records present in the two files, in sorted order of id, to one file named "recordsAll.csv", without sorting a gigantic ArrayList of records. 

Upload your completed recordsAll.csv for submission (you can check whether you have fulfilled 1 million records in recordsAll.csv)
