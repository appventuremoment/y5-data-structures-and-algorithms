Deque

A data structure called a deque is closely related to a queue. The name deque stands for double-ended queue. The difference between the two is that with a deque, you can insert or remove from either end of the queue. Implement a deque using arrays.

Your deque class should contain the following methods:

- size()—returns the number of elements stored in a given deque.
- isEmpty()—determines if a given deque is empty.
- getFirst()—returns the first element of a given deque.
- getLast()—returns the last element of a given deque.
- addFirst(e)—inserts an element e at the beginning of a given deque.
- addLast(e)—inserts an element e at the end of a given deque.
- removeFirst()—removes and returns the first element of a given deque. Throws EmptyCollection Exception if no elements to remove.
- removeLast()—removes and returns the last element of a given deque. Throws EmptyCollection Exception if no elements to remove.

Name your file Deque.java. Your Deque class need to implement the DequeADT.
