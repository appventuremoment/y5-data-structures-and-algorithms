## List using Linked List

Add in relevant code in LinkedList.java to implement the following methods as per discussion in the lecture notes:

- addAfter (T element, T target)
- addToRear (T element)

Add relevant code to implement the Iterator in the LinkedList class (as per discussion page 10). You will have to add the iterator() method in LinkList class and implement your own LinkedIterator class.

Finally, create a file called TestLinkedList.java to test the methods you have coded. In the tester class, you should then use the iterator to traverse your list.
